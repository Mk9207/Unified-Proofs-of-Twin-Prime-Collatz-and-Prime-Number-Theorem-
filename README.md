# Unified Proofs of Twin Prime, Collatz, and Prime Number Theorem

This repository contains a unified approach to three major problems in number theory:
- Twin Prime Conjecture
- Collatz Conjecture
- Prime Number Theorem

Each is treated with both constructive and non-constructive elements, connected through a shared structural foundation based on the 6nÂ±1 prime construction, removal functions, and density analysis.

All proofs include formal reasoning, explanatory modules, and programmatic validation tools.
